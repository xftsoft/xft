<p>More and more companies begin to promote their products and brands through website construction and website. For traditional companies, website construction is nothing new, but many traditional companies still don&#39;t know much about website construction. If you want to promote the website, you must first have a website, and then how to establish the website? When a professional website construction company establishes a website for an enterprise, it has a set of process of establishing a website. Some content is the program of the website construction company, while others are the program that needs to contact the enterprise. The following editor will give you a brief introduction: the process required for website construction and development.</p>

<h4 id="知道我们要做什么。">Know what we&#39;re going to do.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Before building a website, we must first know why to build a website and what role the website plays. This is very important. Website construction must be purposeful and consider the type of work that needs to be done. The main content and theme of website construction have been clearly determined. Especially for the company website, we can&#39;t be as comprehensive as a comprehensive website. When creating a website, we must have a clear theme, and the content must be large, comprehensive, accurate and in-depth. The content to be displayed on the website (products, cases, service items, company introduction, etc.) and some promotional pictures required by the website. Information collection needs to focus on topics. If you want to enrich your website and attract users, you need to collect and organize as much information as possible. As long as the information is richer, the process of building a website is easier. Website information this website information is mainly used to fill in the content of website construction. It is basically based on the vegetarian information collected by enterprises, and the website construction company is auxiliary, because enterprises only understand their own industry, and then the enterprises select materials, so that the technology of the website construction company can be improved.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="组织网站所需的信息。">Information needed to organize the website.</h4>
<ul>
<li>After determining the role and theme of the website, we will begin to prepare information, including the basic information of website construction, such as the domain name of the website, the space of the website, the company&#39;s domain name and the best domain name. From the perspective of search engines and users, top-level domain names such as com, CN and net should be selected. It should be short, easy to understand and easy for others to remember, such as dn.cn. The space server must pay attention to its stability when renting space services. It is recommended to buy proprietary space. Shared space is not conducive to the later optimization of the website. If there are spam websites in the shared space, your website will be more or more. It will be less affected in the future. Implicated. You must pay attention to the archiving of the company&#39;s website. The website you create must be consistent with your business scope, otherwise there will be a lot of trouble in the future, so we don&#39;t talk about the trouble of search engine. Just talk about the industrial and commercial administration department where you are in trouble. The initial submission takes about 22 days, and the subsequent submission takes about 15 days (except holidays).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="设计网站页面网站页面非常重要。">Designing web pages is very important.</h4>
<ul>
<li>After the website is built, users will understand the information we want to promote through the website page. The success of the website largely depends on the planning level of the designer. When planning, we need to consider many aspects, such as overall structure, navigation bar classification, theme color, website style, layout and internal text pictures, which are finalized. Only the website can be familiar and attractive. Website front-end design the website construction company shall build the front-end panel design according to the customer service preference, and provide reasonable suggestions to the company to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of the website. Front end design should consider marketing strategy and user experience. Art pictures need professional website construction artists to complete. Finally, if you are not satisfied, you need enterprise users to decide. I must make a suggestion here. Artists try not to exaggerate. Pictures are basic and can improve users&#39; trust. Degree.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="网站建设：网站页面设计完成后">Website construction: after the website page design is completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Front end developers need to make the designed page pictures into web pages, and back-end programmers can realize the functions of the website through programming. This is a relatively complex process. Consider the big aspects, first the complex aspects, then the details and simple parts. In this way, when there are some problems on the website, it can be better modified. After the content improvement website is made and passes the test, we need to publish the website and bind the resolution server through the domain name, so that we can access the website through the Internet and upload all the content we want. Appear on the website at the same time. Such as enterprise products, case display</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="开展试运营网站建设基本完成后">After the construction of trial operation website is basically completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Building a website does not mean that the website is ready. In the initial stage of the trial operation of the website, the website construction company shall provide basic background operation training for the operators of enterprise users. After operating the company&#39;s website for a few days and understanding the website for a few days, you can put forward reasonable suggestions.</li>
