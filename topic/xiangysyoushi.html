                <div class="topicbody topicbodymb markdown-body">
                    <p>With the development of science and technology, we have now entered the era of interconnection of all things. Today&#39;s website construction, we can allow ourselves to roam on the Internet anytime and anywhere through a variety of different devices and terminals. This greatly facilitates users. But this also puts forward higher requirements for people engaged in website design, website construction and development, because there are many browsing terminal devices and different screen sizes. In order to save the development cost of enterprises and improve the efficiency of resource utilization, we must find a solution that can be fully compatible with different display terminals. Therefore, the responsive website technology of website construction came into being. The following easy point bamboo leaf green will talk about it for you. What are the advantages of responsive websites? Why should companies upgrade their websites to a responsive version as soon as possible.</p>
<p><img src="../static/picture/xftsoft90.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="自适应网站技术是必然趋势">Adaptive website technology is an inevitable trend</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to statistics, in 2018, 350 million mainstream websites around the world used HTML5 CSS3 response technology to build websites. At the same time, there are millions of HTML5 developers. There is no doubt that HTML5 responsive website construction technology will become the Internet field in the next 5-10 years. Leading technology in web development!</li>
<li>If your company&#39;s website construction recognizes this trend earlier than other companies in the same industry, please take action to upgrade your website as soon as possible, then it may become the benchmark of the industry and then become other companies. For the reference of followers, website construction alone can bring considerable traffic to your enterprise, which is equivalent to obtaining additional promotion opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="节省企业投资">Save enterprise investment</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It can save design and development costs</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The role of a responsive web site is to allow web pages to be displayed adaptively according to the screen size. Realize the website compatible with mobile phones, computers, iPads and other display terminals. Compared with the previous html4 technology, this is undoubtedly a huge saving, and html4 technology needs to be specially developed for various display devices of different sizes. Design and development cost of enterprise website construction. For example, looking for an online company with medium service level to design and produce official websites for enterprises costs about 30000 to 50000 yuan. If you set up a computer, iPad and mobile phone respectively, the cost will be about 100000, but now you only need to design to make a set of equipment compatible with all display devices, which will undoubtedly save a lot of money.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Save maintenance personnel costs</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Responsive website construction only needs to update and maintain the content through the management background, which makes the daily management and maintenance of the website easier and convenient, without creating different contents and pictures for different versions of the website, which greatly saves the cost of the enterprise. Maintenance work and maintenance time.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The third is to save space use cost!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Responsive websites use a domain name and a space to automatically adapt to the display. Different from the previous era when the computer version of the mobile version was used to make the website, although the mobile version of the domain name can use the secondary domain name, there is no problem of additional investment, but the computer version of the website and when the mobile version of the website are separated, so it is necessary to buy another space, Independent websites in different spaces will inevitably lead to additional maintenance costs. For large enterprises, this may be nothing, and for most small and micro enterprises, it may be nothing. Said it was a sum that had to be calculated.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Good browsing experience</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Responsive website design is implemented using HTML5 CSS3 Technology (commonly known as H5 Technology). Making responsive websites using H5 technology is just one of his applications. H5 technology has another technology that must be said. Ability is his support for interactive dynamic effects. As we all know, compared with paper albums, the promotion advantage of the website is that the website can realize the panoramic browsing experience of sound, light and shadow, while paper albums can only be static. Yes, interactive dynamic effects are essential when realizing the sound, light and shadow display effects of website design. Previous websites used flash technology, but flash has two main disadvantages, because flash must be encapsulated and integrated before it can be released. It is very inconvenient to change and maintain the content in the future, and the text content in the file can not be recognized by the search engine, which is not conducive to the SEO optimization of the website. Secondly, flash needs to install a plug-in to browse, so as to produce communication effect. H5 technology not only has the ability to produce interactive animation effect no less than flash, but also perfectly solves the two main shortcomings of flash, and greatly improves the user&#39;s browsing experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="更利于推广">More conducive to promotion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Because responsive website construction is essentially a domain name that allows access and browsing on different terminals, that is, when a company carries out network marketing and promotion, different from the computer version website, it only needs to concentrate all its energy on promoting the website. And mobile versions of the website. Separation requires additional investment in different websites.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="提升企业形象">Enhance corporate image</h4>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned earlier, the global mainstream websites have used H5 response technology to build websites. If your company is engaged in international business and foreign customers basically know the company through the website, the website itself uses H5 response technology. The impression of technology on the audience is very important. In fact, even in China, if people see the old html4 technology used by companies to promote websites on the Internet, it will inevitably lead to the alliance of companies lacking innovation and vitality!</li>
