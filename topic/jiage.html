<h6 id="在深圳建造一个公司网站多少钱？搞清这个问题，需求先了解自己对公司网站的期望值和网站建设制造进程及费用构成。">How much is it to build a company website in Shenzhen? To understand this problem, you need to first understand your expectations for the company&#39;s website, the website construction and manufacturing process and cost composition.</h6>
<ul>
<li><p>Let&#39;s talk about expectations first. For example, if you build a website, it&#39;s just a website on your business card? Do you still expect to promote the company, provide information to customers and help bring customers to your company&#39;s affairs? If it is the former, there is no need to customize a website. Just buy a template website, which only needs hundreds of pieces. But if you expect that through the website, customers can find relevant information, think you can bring customers and promote the company&#39;s brand, then website construction? You need to customize a website, and the cost is generally between 10000 and 30000. The following Fangwei network introduces the manufacturing process of enterprise customized website in detail as follows</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cost of general enterprise website construction consists of the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Website domain name registration fee: it is charged annually and needs to be renewed every year. If you don&#39;t pay the domain name in the second year, you can&#39;t use it when it expires. It&#39;s easy to use the. Com.cn domain name, generally 50-100. Of Doc, the domain names of some other countries are more expensive than 300 a year, such as the HK domain name;</li>
<li>Website space server fee: This is determined according to the server type and configuration. Generally, enterprise websites use virtual hosts. It is recommended to use Alibaba cloud virtual hosts, which are relatively stable and cost about a few hundred to 2000. Of Doc, if the budget is enough, maybe the company has multiple websites and can buy an independent server at a cost of more than 4000. This is also charged annually, Annual renewal required;</li>
<li>Website planning fee: it refers to the website interface planning fee, which is generally determined by the level of planners, the number of columns, page length, etc. it is also the place where the difference in enterprise website customization fees is the largest, because some planners pay thousands, while others pay tens of thousands, which also leads to the high-end atmosphere of some web pages, while others are very ordinary;</li>
<li>Website front-end manufacturing cost: after the website page is planned, it is necessary to start manufacturing the front-end. Due to the presentation of H5, some enterprise websites demand more functions, and the functions of manufacturing and display are also more beautiful. Generally, the fees for more functions are more expensive;</li>
<li>Website back-end program cost: after the website is completed, it will generally create a background management system for you to update news, company information, company products, company examples, recruitment information, etc. every day. If it is an enterprise website, the background handling is generally relatively simple, so we just need to pay attention to security and whether the information handling is convenient.</li>
<li>Website language version and website terminal. If you want to do not only the Chinese version, but also the English version and Japanese version, the cost will be higher. Secondly, in addition to manufacturing computer version, you also need to manufacture iPad version and mobile wechat version, so the cost will increase accordingly.</li>
<li>Website maintenance cost: when the website presents problems, the website construction company needs to help you deal with the problems in time, which involves labor cost.</li>
<li>The salesman&#39;s Commission and the company&#39;s expenses shall be shared equally. Generally, the demand salesperson is responsible for the negotiation and cooperation of projects, and the salesperson usually has a commission, about 10-15%. There is no need to say that the company&#39;s expenses are shared equally.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to website construction, I believe you are interested in &quot;how much does it cost to build a company website?&quot; I should have a preliminary understanding of this problem.</li>
</ul>
